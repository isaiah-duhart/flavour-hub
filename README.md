# html-recipes

# Project
This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. The goal of this project is to build a simple website that displays a collection of recipes using only HTML.

## Purpose
The project aims to demonstrate the following skills:

- Structuring a website with proper HTML tags.
- Linking pages together to create a multi-page website.
- Embedding images and working with lists.

## Reflection
By completing this project, I will have reinforced my understanding of basic HTML structure, linking pages, and organizing content in a meaningful way. This will serve as a foundation for more complex projects in the future.
