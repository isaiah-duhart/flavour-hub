      skinless chicken thighs that get charred under the broiler then cooked in

      <li>1 large onion, sliced</li>
      <li>2 serrano chiles, stemmed, seeded and chopped</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon finely grated ginger</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, finely grated</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried whole fenugreek leaves</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Hungarian paprika</li>
      <li>One 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
      <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>Chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems, for serving</li>
      <li>Basmati rice, for serving</li>
      <li>Naan, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        For the chicken marinade: Whisk together the yogurt, ginger, salt, chili
        powder, garam masala, pepper, turmeric and garlic in a large bowl until
        combined. Toss the chicken in the spiced yogurt marinade until evenly
        coated. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 3 hours
        and up to 24. (Overnight works best.)
      </li>
      <li>
        For the sauce: Melt the ghee in a large Dutch oven or wide heavy pot
        over medium heat. Add the onions and serrano, season with 1 teaspoon
        salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are golden and
        beginning to caramelize, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the ginger and garlic and
        cook, stirring, until very fragrant and the ginger starts to turn golden
        and sticks to the bottom of the pot, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the fenugreek
        leaves, garam masala, chili powder and paprika and cook, stirring
        occasionally, until very fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes,
        breaking them up into pieces with a spoon, and bring to a boil. Reduce
        the heat and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the sauce
        has reduced by half and the tomatoes are very tender, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the hot sauce cool for about 5 minutes or so, then transfer it to a
        blender filling no more than halfway. (If your blender is small, you may
        need to work in batches.) Remove the center cap from the lid and place
        it on the blender. Cover the lid with a kitchen towel to catch
        splatters, and pulse until smooth. Add 1/4 cup heavy cream and puree
        until creamy. Pour into a clean pot and bring to a simmer. Season with
        salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, position a rack directly under the broiler and preheat to
        high. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and set a wire rack inside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange the chicken in a single layer on the rack. Broil until the
        chicken starts to brown in spots, 3 to 6 minutes per side (it will not
        be cooked through). Remove from the broiler. When cool enough to handle,
        cut the chicken into 1-inch pieces. Add the chicken to the simmering
        sauce, cover and cook until the chicken is cooked through, 8 to 10
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top the chicken and sauce with cilantro. Serve with rice and naan.
      </li>
    </ol>
